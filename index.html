      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Mobile Inpatient Care at Home (MIC@Home) is a healthcare model that delivers hospital-level care to patients in
        the comfort of their homes through remote monitoring, telehealth consultations, and periodic home visits by
        medical professionals. Developed in response to rising hospital overcrowding, this program was conceived to
        alleviate pressure on traditional healthcare facilities while providing continuous, coordinated care for
        patients with a variety of conditions that require daily, but not urgent care. However, patient experience comes
        at a cost when patients are warded at home and do not have 24/7 access to a nurse.
        <br><br>
        This project, MediHeal, seeks to address the mental burden associated with the absence of a healthcare provider
        through an application that helps address patients' queries and helps them to track their MIC@Home related
        duties, like a nurse usually would. Thus, MediHeal seeks to function as a 24/7 available nurse assistant for the
        patient, helping to fill in the gaps in between the daily nurse visits.
        <br><br>
        This report focuses on the ideation, planning, prototyping and validation of the different aspects of the
        MediHeal application and the integration of these aspects to produce a final product that can ultimately help
        patients enrolled in MIC@Home.

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1 Current Situation in Singapore</h3>
        <p>
          Singapore's healthcare system is confronting escalating pressures stemming from significant demographic and
          epidemiological transitions. Current projections indicate that by 2030, 24.1% of the resident population will
          be aged 65 years or above, precipitating a substantial increase in demand for both acute medical interventions
          and long-term chronic disease management services [1].
          <br><br>
          According to operational data, public hospital bed occupancy rates persistently exceed 85% [2], surpassing the
          internationally recognized optimal threshold of 70-75% for maintaining healthcare service efficiency [3]. This
          capacity constraint manifests in several critical operational challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Extended patient stays, with the average length of hospitalization increasing by 12% between 2019 and 2023
            [4]
          </li>
          <li>
            Prolonged emergency department wait times, with admission delays lasting an average of thirty minutes longer
            than baselines prior to the pandemic [5]
          </li>
          <li>
            Significant bed blockage, with 15-20% of acute care beds occupied by patients medically cleared for
            discharge but awaiting appropriate step-down care arrangements [6]
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These systemic challenges collectively underscore the imperative for transformative care delivery models that
          enhance healthcare system capacity while maintaining service quality and patient outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Current Measures</h3>
        <div id="sub-section-1-header-2-1">
          <h4>1.2.1 Hospital-Based Measures</h4>
          <p>
            The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to add 1,900 new hospital beds by 2026 to address immediate
            infrastructure constraints [7] . Concurrently, hospitals are adopting dynamic bed management systems to
            improve patient flow and reduce length-of-stay through standardized discharge protocols. However, physical
            expansion alone cannot fully address projected demand growth from Singapore's aging population.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sub-section-1-header-2-2">
          <h4>1.2.2 Community Care Apartments</h4>
          <p>
            Singapore has implemented Community Care Apartments (CCAs) as a transitional care solution, integrating
            senior housing with basic healthcare services to alleviate pressure on hospital bed capacity. As of 2025,
            the program has expanded to 1,200 units across five housing estates, demonstrating measurable impact through
            a 22% reduction in hospital readmissions among residents [8]. However, current capacity meets only an
            estimated 15% of projected needs, with waiting periods extending six to eight months in high-demand regions
            [9]. The model's physical infrastructure requirements present inherent scalability limitations in
            land-constrained Singapore, necessitating complementary virtual care solutions to achieve meaningful
            system-wide impact.

        <div id="sub-section-1-header-2-3">
          <h4>1.2.3 Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home (MIC@Home)</h4>
          <p>
            MIC@Home is an innovative healthcare delivery model developed by MOH to provide hospital-level care in
            patients' homes. This program represents a fundamental shift in healthcare delivery, combining advanced
            remote monitoring technologies with in-person clinical care from multidisciplinary medical teams.
          </p>
          <image-component id="fig-1" tag="image" source="assets/fig1.png" subtitle="Figure 1. Overview of MIC@Home">
          </image-component>
          <p>
            The MIC@Home program simultaneously addresses multiple critical healthcare system challenges through its
            innovative design. Primarily, it mitigates bed capacity constraints through the establishment of "virtual
            wards," having demonstrated the conservation of over 9,000 hospital bed days since program inception in 2022
            [10]. Clinically, the model has shown superior patient outcomes, including a 35% reduction in
            hospital-acquired infections alongside exceptional patient satisfaction scores of 92%. From a health
            economics perspective, the program delivers substantial efficiency gains, providing equivalent care at
            20-25% reduced cost per episode relative to conventional hospitalization[11].
            <br><br>
            This care model holds particular strategic value for Singapore's unique urban context, offering a scalable
            healthcare solution unconstrained by physical infrastructure limitations. With current expansion plans
            targeting 300 virtual beds, MIC@Home serves dual purposes: as an immediate capacity enhancement measure and
            as a pioneering prototype for next-generation healthcare delivery models [12].

          Without predefined problem statements from MOHT, our research concentrated on identifying operational
          challenges in the MIC@Home program. Through extensive stakeholder engagement, including in-depth interviews
          with nursing staff and consultation sessions with the MOHT implementation team, we developed a patient journey

          The MIC@Home program reveals inherent tensions between healthcare efficiency and patient-centered care. While
          intended to streamline post-hospitalization recovery, the current model inadvertently places excessive
          responsibility on patients without providing adequate support systems. The identified pain points,
          particularly around technological complexity and care transitions reflect deeper systemic issues in how we
          operationalize home-based care. Digital solutions present compelling opportunities, but their effectiveness
          hinges on addressing three critical dimensions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Redesigning clinician workflows to accommodate remote monitoring
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebuilding patient trust in self-management tools
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating meaningful feedback loops between patients and providers
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, there are certainly multiple design opportunities for MIC@Home to be further
          optimised to increase its outreach, to reach the target of 10% of hospital beds in Singapore.

          Using these design opportunities, several How-Might-We statements are generated to better
          frame the problem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How might we provide patients with simple, personalized reminders and guides to help them manage medication,
            monitor vitals and follow daily care routines independently?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we provide patients with instant, personalized health reassurance and smart escalation to
            healthcare providers when needed?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we create an intuitive vital sign monitoring system that helps patients track their health trends
            with clarity and confidence, reducing unnecessary anxiety?

        <h3>2.3. Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Patients recovering at home need a supportive way to monitor their health, receive personalized feedback, and
          stay connected to their healthcare team because they often feel isolated and anxious without clear guidance
          and real-time insights into their condition. This lack of support diminishes their confidence in the recovery
          process and hinders their ability to actively engage in their own health journey.

        The MIC@Home Monitoring System delivers an integrated digital health platform that transforms remote patient
        care through three key services:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Smart Communication Platform - Secure messaging and automated alerts connect patients with clinicians in
          real-time, reducing isolation and enabling timely interventions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Intelligent Vital Monitoring - AI-powered trend analysis with intuitive traffic-light displays helps patients
          understand their health status while flagging critical changes for care teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personalized Care Engine - An adaptive support system that delivers context-aware medication and measurement
          reminders, intelligently adjusts notification frequency based on patient preferences and compliance patterns,
          and provides tailored educational content aligned with each patient's recovery journey.

      <h2>4. Design Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for virtual patient monitoring that facilitates seamless
        communication between patients and the healthcare team. This will be achieved through a software system
        featuring modules tailored to meet the specific needs of patients, nurses, and hospital care teams. A key
        component of this solution is the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to power an advanced chatbot
        feature. This chatbot will enhance patient engagement by addressing secondary-level concerns in the absence of
        healthcare professionals, providing reminders for medication and vital signs monitoring, and generating
        concise summaries for nursing staff. This approach is designed to improve care coordination, streamline
        workflows, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.

        <h3>Appendix 3: List of Features (Patient Module)</h3>
        <p>
          There are three main features in the patient module. Namely, care plan to routine reminders, personalized
          health report and AI-powered chatbot.
          <br><br>

            <b>Feature 1- Care plan to routine reminders</b>
            <br><br>

            A care plan is a personalized document that outlines the specific health needs of individuals receiving
            care. It acts as a roadmap for healthcare providers, detailing the necessary interventions and strategies
            tailored to each patient's unique medical needs. Developed through comprehensive assessments by a doctor,
            care plans are regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to the changing needs of the patient. They encompass
            essential information on medical management, vital signs monitoring and patient allergies ensuring a
            coordinated and effective approach to patient care.
            <br><br>

            Patients are able to get the routine reminders in the following ways:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Push notification
              </li>
              <li>
                In app homepage notification section
              </li>
              <li>
                During casual interaction with the AI-powered chatbot
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>

            <br><br>

            With the care plan, patient information and medical history provided by the hospital team, we can extract
            key essential entities, including vital signs to be monitored and the specific times for monitoring.
            Additionally, we will capture details such as the names of medications, their dosages, and administration
            schedules, along with the patient's specific medical conditions. This information will be systematically
            stored in a patient information database in the backend. This information will firstly, be used to display
            or send push notification to patients when the medication or vitals has to be recorded. Secondly, the
            information can facilitate efficient access and management of patient data when interfacing with the Large
            Language Model (LLM) through Groq API to send reminders to patients through the chatbot feature.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Feature 2 - Personalized health report from vitals reported.</b>
            <br><br>

            The personalized health report feature enables the generation of comprehensive medical health reports based
            on the vital signs submitted by patients. As patients log their vitals, such as blood pressure, heart rate,
            temperature, SpO2 and blood glucose level, the system compiles this data into a user-friendly format that
            highlights trends and deviations from normal ranges. This report can be generated from the vitals recorded
            within the day to across a few days. This provides patients with insights into their health status.
            Regularly updated health reports foster proactive management of chronic conditions and encourage patient
            engagement in their own care.

          <li>
            <b>Feature 3 - AI powered Chatbot</b>
            <br><br>

            The AI-powered chatbot is designed using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to ensure responses
            are accurate and relevant based on a curated knowledge base. This chatbot serves as an interactive support
            tool for patients, addressing common inquiries related to their recovery journey and providing guidance on
            managing their health effectively. By offering immediate assistance for secondary-level concerns, the
            chatbot enhances patient engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, it can facilitate routine check-ins,
            remind patients of upcoming appointments, and generate concise summaries for nursing staff, thereby
            streamlining communication within the healthcare team.
            <br><br>

          <li>
            <b>Feature 4 - Concise summary generation</b>
            <br><br>

            While the chatbot is equipped to handle patient queries effectively, it is essential that the medical advice
            provided by the chatbot is communicated to the nurses. This ensures that nurses are informed about the
            concerns and inquiries raised by patients, even in the absence of a medical professional. To address this
            need, we propose a feature that delivers a concise summary to nurses regarding the queries resolved by the
            chatbot, as well as any outstanding questions that remain unresolved. This functionality will enable nurses
            to better understand their patients' concerns and provide more informed care.

          <li>
            <b>Feature 5- Easy documentation</b>
            <br><br>

            Recognizing that patients' homes may not provide an ideal environment for nurses to set up personal devices
            for documentation, we aim to alleviate this challenge by implementing a speech-to-text input with
            transcription functionality. This feature will enable nurses to efficiently perform documentation updates
            during patient visits, allowing them to focus more on patient care rather than the constraints of their
            documentation process. By streamlining the documentation workflow in this manner, we enhance the overall
            efficiency and effectiveness of home healthcare delivery.
