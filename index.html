        <h2> 1. An Introduction To MIC@Home </h2>
        <video-component tag="intro" source="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRxcN-WTJig" 
          subtitle="Video: An introduction to MIC@Home"></video-component>
        <p>
          The Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home (MIC@Home) initiative, launched by the Ministry of Health (MOH) through the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), aims to offer eligible patients the option of receiving inpatient-level care in their own homes rather than in a hospital ward. The program was designed to alleviate the growing strain on hospital bed capacity in Singapore, which is particularly relevant in light of the aging population and increasing healthcare demands.
          <br><br>
          Since its pilot in 2022, the program has proven successful in improving patient satisfaction, reducing hospital-acquired infections, and lowering the length of hospital stays, while still providing care equivalent to what patients would receive in a hospital setting. By 2023, over 2,000 patients had benefited from MIC@Home, saving around 9,000 hospital bed days (<i>Singapore's Public Hospital Bed Crunch: Are Radical Solutions Needed?</i>, 2023). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
        <h3>1.1. Moving Care To The Home</h3>
        <p>
          The MIC@Home model allows patients with a range of conditions, including skin infections, urinary tract infections, and congestive heart failure, to receive care in the comfort of their own homes (Figure 1). Patients in this program receive hospital-level care at home, including vital sign monitoring, intravenous treatments, and blood tests, delivered by a combination of teleconsultations and home visits by a dedicated team of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/mic_intro.png"
          subtitle="Figure 1: Overview of MIC@home">
        </image-component>

        <p>
          One of the primary benefits of MIC@Home is the remote monitoring of patient conditions. This allows healthcare teams to track patients' progress, and in cases of deterioration, emergency medical services can be activated, ensuring that the patient is provided immediate care, without the need for an inpatient stay. The initiative also allows patients to avoid the risks of hospital-acquired infections, further enhancing their recovery experience.
          <br><br>
          In line with the government's five-year plan to add 1,900 beds to the public healthcare system by 2026, MIC@Home serves as a critical tool in managing hospital bed shortages while maintaining high standards of care (<i>DELIVERING CARE BEYOND HOSPITALS</i>, 2024). The program is expected to increase the number of virtual beds to 300 by the end of 2024.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Problem Identification</h2>
        <p>
          With no initial problem statement provided by MOHT, our task began by identifying gaps and challenges within the MIC@Home model. Through in-depth interviews with MIC@Home nurses and discussions with the MOHT team, we examined patient and nurse journeys to identify specific pain points, limitations, and unmet needs (Appendix 1). This section outlines these insights and the resulting problem statements that will drive our approach to enhancing home-based patient care.

      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1-1">
        <h4>2.1.1. Patients' User Journey</h4>
        <p>
          To better understand the experiences of patients within the MIC@Home program, a user journey map was developed (Appendix 2).
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/patient_journey_map.png"
          subtitle="Figure 2: Patient journey map with identified pain points">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          In the Before Daily Visits phase, patients are responsible for managing their health independently. This involves monitoring vital signs such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate and SPO2 using the medical devices provided by the hospital (Figure 3). They must then document these readings by writing them down and taking pictures of the notes, which are subsequently sent to the healthcare team via WhatsApp. Pain points in this phase include anxiety about recovery progress, as patients may be uncertain whether they are improving or if their health is stable. Additionally, there is uncertainty about the accuracy of vital sign measurements, as patients may not feel confident in using the devices correctly, leading to doubts about the reliability of their readings.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/patient_recordings.png"
          subtitle="Figure 3: A patient enrolled in the MIC@Home program using monitoring equipment and manually recording vitals">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          During daily visits, healthcare providers check in on the patient's condition and assess their progress. One common pain point here is forgetting the medication schedule; patients may struggle to remember when to take their medications, which could lead to missed doses.
          <br><br>

          After the healthcare provider leaves, patients continue to monitor their health independently. One of the main pain points in this phase is difficulty remembering the instructions provided by the healthcare team. Since patients have to rely on manual methods of logging data, the process can feel cumbersome, and there’s a risk of missing important steps in their care plan. Another pain point is physical or emotional discomfort during or after medical exams, which can make patients feel overwhelmed or stressed.
          <br><br>

          During the recovery process, patients often feel disconnected from the healthcare team once the daily visits end. A key pain point is the lack of clarity around diagnosis and care plans, which leads to uncertainty about the recovery process. Additionally, patients experience feelings of emotional isolation, especially when they are left to manage their health without daily interaction with a healthcare provider.

          </table>
          <br><br>

          This highlights three main challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve the patient experience within the MIC@Home program. The solution should focus on simplifying medication management to reduce confusion and anxiety, addressing the communication gaps by improving access to healthcare providers for timely clarifications, and providing timely feedback on logged vitals to help patients track their recovery progress.

        <h4>2.1.4. Problem Statement (Patients)</h4>
        <p>
          Our exploration of user journeys, patient interviews, and identified pain points led to a clear problem statement:
          <br><br>

          Patients recovering at home need a supportive way to monitor their health, receive personalized feedback, and stay connected to their healthcare team because they often feel isolated and anxious without clear guidance and real-time insights into their condition. This lack of support diminishes their confidence in the recovery process and hinders their ability to actively engage in their own health journey.

        <h4>2.2.1. Nurses' User Journey</h4>
        <p>
          To gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of nurses within the MIC@Home program, a user journey map was created (Appendix 2).
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/nurse_journey_map.png"
          subtitle="Figure 6: Nurse journey map with identified pain points">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          The journey begins with the Before Daily Visits phase, where nurses prepare by reviewing patient records, checking for updates from other healthcare professionals, and ensuring they have the necessary equipment and medications for the visit. This phase is vital for setting up effective care, but nurses often face challenges such as managing large amounts of patient data and ensuring its accuracy. These issues can delay preparations and potentially hinder timely care delivery.
          <br><br>

          In the During Daily Visits phase, nurses assess patient conditions, administer treatments, and engage with patients and their families. Time constraints are a major issue in this phase, as nurses are expected to provide comprehensive care within limited timeframes. This pressure can make it difficult for nurses to fully understand a patient’s condition or address all of their concerns. The emotional demands of providing care, especially to patients who may feel isolated or anxious, add another layer of complexity.
          <br><br>

          Following the visit, nurses enter the Post-Visit Documentation phase, where they update patient records and adjust care plans based on their findings. The challenge here is the pressure to complete documentation quickly while managing other responsibilities. The sheer volume of paperwork can lead to missed details, which may affect the quality of patient care. Furthermore, the need to rely on informal communication channels, such as WhatsApp, to share information with other healthcare professionals increases the risk of miscommunication, which can have significant consequences on patient care. Nurses also report the additional burden of maintaining hardcopy records, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
          <br><br>

          The Collaboration and Communication phase is essential as nurses must communicate with other healthcare team members to ensure seamless care. However, gaps in communication and incomplete handovers between teams or shifts can leave nurses with fragmented information, making it harder to make informed decisions and maintain continuity of care.

        <h4>2.2.2. Current Limitations (Nurses)</h4>
        <p>
          Based on insights gathered from interviews and user journey maps, three key limitations were identified for nurses within the MIC@Home program:

          <table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <caption><i>Table 2. Key Challenges and Limitations (Nurses)</i></caption>

              <td>1</td>
              <td>“I’m juggling so many tasks during the visit that keeping up with documentation feels impossible. I worry about forgetting important details later on in the case notes.”</td>
              <td>Nurses <b>face challenges in keeping up with documentation</b> alongside multiple tasks, risking missed details in case notes, impacting patient care quality and increasing their stress.</td>
            </tr>

              <td>2</td>
              <td>“With the limited time I have with my patients, I can’t get a full picture of their conditions, which makes it hard to give them holistic care. I feel like I’m missing key details that could make a difference.”</td>
              <td>Limited patient interaction time <b>hinders nurses from fully understanding patient conditions</b>, affecting their ability to provide holistic care and potentially missing critical health aspects.</td>
            </tr>

              <td>“With so many teams taking different shifts, I’m not always clear on a patient’s situation as keeping up updates between teams is tough, and I often feel out of the loop on important patient details.”</td>
              <td>Frequent handovers and <b>fragmented communication create gaps</b>, leaving nurses out of the loop on crucial patient information.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br><br>

          The primary challenges faced by nurses in the MIC@Home program include managing extensive patient data, navigating time constraints during home visits, and overcoming communication gaps between healthcare teams. To address these issues, solutions should focus on streamlining data management, enhancing time management capabilities, and improving communication channels to ensure seamless care coordination and support nurses in delivering efficient and high-quality patient care.

          The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for virtual patient monitoring that facilitates seamless communication between patients and the healthcare team. This will be achieved through a software system featuring modules tailored to meet the specific needs of patients, nurses, and hospital care teams. A key component of this solution is the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to power an advanced chatbot feature. This chatbot will enhance patient engagement by addressing secondary-level concerns in the absence of healthcare professionals, providing reminders for medication and vital signs monitoring, and generating concise summaries for nursing staff. This approach is designed to improve care coordination, streamline workflows, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.

          <br><br>

          Considering the objectives of the MIC@Home program, which aims to alleviate the constraints faced by hospitals, we have selected to advance with Concept A. This concept incorporates several innovative features: an uploading mechanism for vital updates, a RAG-implemented knowledge-constrained AI chatbot, speech-to-text input for nurses to facilitate updates, and a voice recognition-based chatbot.
          <br><br>

          This approach minimizes the reliance on hospital resources, effectively reducing their workload while ensuring that patients continue to receive adequate care in the comfort of their homes. By leveraging technology, we can enhance communication between patients and healthcare providers, streamline vital updates, and improve overall patient engagement in their care journeys. This model not only supports effective patient management but also aligns with the broader goals of the MIC@Home initiative to provide equivalent hospital-level care outside traditional settings.

        <h2>6. Proposed Solution Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          From our initial concept development, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements, we can start narrowing down the use of technology in the development of our application to a few options. From there, we can compare the aspects of different alternatives to determine the best choice for us to use for the development of our solution. Then, we can start to construct the structure for our application.
          <br><br>

          As with most systems-level application projects, there is a separation of concerns regarding the application’s functionality into the frontend and the backend. The frontend serves as the main interface between the user and the application, covering the application’s main functionality with an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.

        <h4>6.1.2. Decision For Frontend</h4>
        <p>
          In the end, the framework that we chose is <b>Flutter</b> for a few main reasons. Firstly, most of the team have no experience with traditional frontend languages like Javascript or HTML, which means that the edge that React Native has over Flutter in terms of familiarity with the language is non-existent in the context of our team. Thus, the ease of setting up a Flutter development environment and the gentler learning curve associated with Flutter is comparatively beneficial for the team. In addition to that, when the team starts scaling the application up and implementing more features, debugging and maintenance is much easier due to static analysis being possible with Dart.

        <h4>6.2.2. Decision For Backend</h4>
        <p>
          After considering the languages we should use, we decided on <b>Python</b>. A key consideration for this decision is that python has a lot of support for AI, with the Langchain package being very useful to meet the requirements of the application. This level of support is not really as extensive for the other languages mentioned. Additionally, of all of the languages mentioned, the team is the most familiar with Python due to having used it in prior courses. That, combined with the fact that Python has simple syntax makes Python very easy to pick up for the development of our backend.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2-3">
        <h4>6.2.3. Proposed Backend Architecture</h4>
        <p>
          Below is a graphical summary of what our proposed backend architecture will look like.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/backend_archi_summary.png"
          subtitle="Figure 17: Proposed Backend Architecture Overview">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          There are two servers, one customized for supporting the chatbot interface and the other supporting the rest of the requests from the frontend, with both running with Python. This architecture of having two servers is mainly to meet the requirements of the chatbot interface, which is different from the rest of the interfaces that require information from the server.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2-4">
        <h4>6.2.4. Chatbot Server</h4>
        <p>
          The chatbot server is using Langchain, a framework for incorporating LLMs and databases into application logic. This logic is supported with LangServe and FastAPI, which serves to accept client requests and send back the processed responses. Below is a graphical representation of the chatbot server architecture.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/backend_archi_chatbot.png"
          subtitle="Figure 18: LangServe server structure">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          The server accepts API requests with FastAPI, then using the credentials of the user sent in the request to query the patient interaction database and care plan to retrieve the patient’s care plan and past conversations with the chatbot. With the care plan and patient prompt, the knowledge database can then be queried to retrieve the most relevant documents based on the patient’s prompt and medical condition. All of the queried knowledge is then added as the context together with the system prompt and patient’s prompt to query the LLM, in this case Groq API, to receive a response. The information used as context constrains the LLM’s response, making it use the documents to retrieve information for its response, greatly reducing hallucinations from the LLM. The system prompt instructs the chatbot to construct its response with the appropriate tone and mannerisms that are desired, which in our case is to act like a nurse.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/backend_archi_storage.png"
          subtitle="Figure 19: Patient Prompt Storage">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          In addition to sending back a response to the frontend chatbot interface, the chatbot server also processes and stores the patient’s prompt into databases. Notably, the patient’s raw prompt is stored in the patient interaction database together with the chatbot server’s generated response, and the patient prompt is passed through a LLM to extract and store the patient’s vitals data if present.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2-5">
        <h4>6.2.5. Flask Server</h4>
        <p>
          The server for all of the other responses uses Flask, a lightweight server framework for Python. This server services all of the other requests that come from the frontend, which can be seen in the diagram below.
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/backend_archi_flask.png"
          subtitle="Figure 20: Flask server structure">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          Most of the other requests from the frontend either constitute simple data storage or retrieval, with the exception of the patient summary generation feature. This feature requires a summary to be generated from the past patient conversation and so a LLM must be used to summarize the queried raw patient conversations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2-6">
        <h4>6.2.6. LLM Choices</h4>
        <p>
          There are many choices of LLMs to use today, with ChatGPT, Gemini, Ollama, and many others. There are many benchmarks to show the relative performance of LLMs as well, as seen by figure 21 (LLM Leaderboard 2024, n.d.).
          <br><br>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/llm_comparison.png"
          subtitle="Figure 21: Comparison of ChatGPT and Alternative APIs for LLM Integration">
          </image-component>
          <br><br>

          Based on Figure 21, it can be seen that OpenAI’s ChatGPT is regarded as the best performing model for general applications and for reasoning, which suits our chatbot’s requirements well. Therefore, in the later iterations of the application, the backend is likely to use OpenAI’s GPT API for its LLM queries. However, as OpenAI’s APIs require money to be used, it is not advisable to use it to test the initial backend configuration. Hence, the team is using Groq API, a free API service with a selection of models like llama3, for initial stages of the application development.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-6-header-2-7">
        <h4>6.2.7. Database Management System Choices</h4>
        <p>
          From the backend architecture, there are five databases that will be used to store information. As for what types of databases will be used, there are a specific few to be taken into consideration, namely relational databases like MySQL, document-based databases like MongoDB, and vector databases like ChromaDB.
          <br><br>

          Relational databases use a collection of tables with references to each other, allowing data retrieved from a table to be used as the key to query another. This compartmentalizes information in the tables and the relation between tables improves query timings even with many data entries. Thus, this style of database is suitable for user data such as the patient vitals and care plan.
          <br><br>

          Document-based databases envision collections of data as documents instead of tables, which is more intuitive for certain types of data to be stored (<i>Document Database - NoSQL</i>, n.d.). This means that related data is stored in similar documents, and querying the database does not require a structured query, hence this style of database also being termed NoSQL. This style of database is fit for our patient conversation data and nurse reports, which can be seen as more of a long document than snippets of information in a table.
          <br><br>

          Vector databases store data as vector embeddings of the data instead of the data itself. This is particularly useful in retrieval operations of data, allowing a query to retrieve data by similarity of embeddings (<i>What Is a Vector Database & How Does It Work? Use Cases + Examples</i>, 2023). This is particularly useful in the implementation of RAG as a prompt can be embedded to query the database and retrieve the documents most similar in context. Therefore, this style of database is the most suitable for our medical information database.

        <h2>7. Future plans</h2>
        <p>
          With the feedback from MOHT, we will be iterating on our concept design so that it could better fulfill our stakeholder needs.  We will continue to work with MOHT nurses to curate a database of medical knowledge for the chatbot and draft out a care plan for the routine reminder system. Additionally, we will assess the feasibility of the chatbot's constrained knowledge base in addressing patient queries. This will involve comparing its responses with those provided by trained healthcare professionals to ensure accuracy and reliability. By refining these elements, we aim to enhance the overall functionality and effectiveness of our solution in delivering quality patient care. Below is the image of the timeline of the tasks we will be carrying out from now till the end of the next semester (Figure 22). We aim to build a functional system for the nurses to test out the functionality of the chatbot and the app by semester 2 recess week for further iteration and refinement of the features.

        <h3>Appendix 3: List of Features (Patient Module)</h3>
        <p>
          There are three main features in the patient module. Namely, care plan to routine reminders, personalized health report and AI-powered chatbot. 
          <br><br>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Feature 1- Care plan to routine reminders</b>
              <br><br>

              A care plan is a personalized document that outlines the specific health needs of individuals receiving care. It acts as a roadmap for healthcare providers, detailing the necessary interventions and strategies tailored to each patient's unique medical needs. Developed through comprehensive assessments by a doctor, care plans are regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to the changing needs of the patient. They encompass essential information on medical management, vital signs monitoring and patient allergies ensuring a coordinated and effective approach to patient care.
              <br><br>

              Patients are able to get the routine reminders in the following ways: 
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Push notification 
                </li>
                <li>
                  In app homepage notification section 
                </li>
                <li>
                  During casual interaction with the AI-powered chatbot
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>

              <image-component tag="image" source="assets/patient_notifs.png"
              subtitle="Patient Module Wireframe for Feature 1">
              </image-component>
              <br><br>

              With the care plan, patient information and medical history provided by the hospital team, we can extract key essential entities, including vital signs to be monitored and the specific times for monitoring. Additionally, we will capture details such as the names of medications, their dosages, and administration schedules, along with the patient's specific medical conditions. This information will be systematically stored in a patient information database in the backend. This information will firstly, be used to display or send push notification to patients when the medication or vitals has to be recorded. Secondly, the information can facilitate efficient access and management of patient data when interfacing with the Large Language Model (LLM) through Groq API to send reminders to patients through the chatbot feature.
              <br><br>

              <image-component tag="image" source="assets/feature1_flow.png"
              subtitle="Overview of Routine Reminder System Based on Care Plan Data">

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Feature 2 - Personalized health report from vitals reported.</b>
              <br><br>

              The personalized health report feature enables the generation of comprehensive medical health reports based on the vital signs submitted by patients. As patients log their vitals, such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, SpO2 and blood glucose level, the system compiles this data into a user-friendly format that highlights trends and deviations from normal ranges. This report can be generated from the vitals recorded within the day to across a few days. This provides patients with insights into their health status. Regularly updated health reports foster proactive management of chronic conditions and encourage patient engagement in their own care.
              <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Feature 3 - AI powered Chatbot</b>
              <br><br>

              The AI-powered chatbot is designed using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to ensure responses are accurate and relevant based on a curated knowledge base. This chatbot serves as an interactive support tool for patients, addressing common inquiries related to their recovery journey and providing guidance on managing their health effectively. By offering immediate assistance for secondary-level concerns, the chatbot enhances patient engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, it can facilitate routine check-ins, remind patients of upcoming appointments, and generate concise summaries for nursing staff, thereby streamlining communication within the healthcare team.
              <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Feature 4 - Concise summary generation</b>
              <br><br>

              While the chatbot is equipped to handle patient queries effectively, it is essential that the medical advice provided by the chatbot is communicated to the nurses. This ensures that nurses are informed about the concerns and inquiries raised by patients, even in the absence of a medical professional. To address this need, we propose a feature that delivers a concise summary to nurses regarding the queries resolved by the chatbot, as well as any outstanding questions that remain unresolved. This functionality will enable nurses to better understand their patients' concerns and provide more informed care. 
              <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Feature 5- Easy documentation</b>
              <br><br>

              Recognizing that patients' homes may not provide an ideal environment for nurses to set up personal devices for documentation, we aim to alleviate this challenge by implementing a speech-to-text input with transcription functionality. This feature will enable nurses to efficiently perform documentation updates during patient visits, allowing them to focus more on patient care rather than the constraints of their documentation process. By streamlining the documentation workflow in this manner, we enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of home healthcare delivery.
